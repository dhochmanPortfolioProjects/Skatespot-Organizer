# Skatespot-Organizer

## Introduction
Welcome to our Skatespot Organizer app! The goal of this app is to provide fellow skateboarders around the world with an easy way to store and catalogue their favorite places ("spots") to skateboard. An integral part of street skateboarding consists of finding spots, often with unique architecture, to skate. Skateboarders spend countless hours searching for new spots, deciding which spots to skate on a given day, and trying to find out about spots from others. Despite the significant roll of spot searching, cataloguing, and sharing, the ways that skateboarders resort to doing this is surprisingly primitive; most skateboarders only have a mental library of spots, remembering only vaguely the general vicinity of and types of obstacles at each spot. Consequently, returning to and sharing spots often is not always as easy as it could be.

The motivation behind making this app comes from the observation that there is a shortage of good apps that allow skateboarders to organize and share spots in an easy way. While there are a few skatespot apps out there, most of the ones we've used suffer from one or more of the following problems:

1). Inability to keep spots private: While sharing is what happens to most spots after they are discovered, skateboarders often prefer to share certain spots with only a select few people. The reason is that spots can be become "busts" (non-skateable) if they become too widely known and popular. So, more than altruistic sharing, what happens mainly is reciprocal sharing (trading of spots) between friends and acquaintances. Thus, while our app will allow user to share spots, it won't force them to. Skatespot Organizer will allow users to have a private collection of spots as well as to share spots (in a user-controlled way) with the larger skate community.

2). Spot search/retrieval functionality is limited: Some apps allow users to see all spots within a given radius of a specific city, their current location, or based on the spots' attributes (name, type, etc.), however, we are yet to see an app that integrates all of these search options together in one app. Since spot search/retrieval will be a primary function of this app, we hope to make this task as user-friendly as possible.

3). Excessive target audience: Many spot apps encompass multiple extreme spots and force these (often quite disparate) communities of users to share the same platform. This is nice if you are a jack of all extreme sports, however, from our personal experience, we feel that many users would rather be involved in only one arena (per app or at a time), or at least have that option available to them.

4). Sloppiness: The user experience offered by most of the apps we've seen so far is degraded in part by simple spelling mistakes, awkward user controls, etc. While we understand that it would be impossible to completely satisfy all users in their user experience, we'd like our app to have a clean user interface and be both easy and intuitive to use.
